# Movie app project (They're here!)

## Overview

### What does it do?
They're here is a movie review, subscription, statistic database app. Users can browse movie reviews, statistics
and subscribe to a monthly magazine that is available to download in PDF form upon successful registration.

### How it works...

making code easily accessible and tidy. The source code and SQL database are deployed to Heroku, users with adminstrative 
privelages may add/edit objects (i.e. magazines, movies) for different models from django's built in admin panel.
